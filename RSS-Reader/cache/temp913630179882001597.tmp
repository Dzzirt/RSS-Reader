Now, researchers have shown how they can create more NV centers, which makes sensing magnetic fields easier, using a relatively simple method that can be done in many labs. They describe their results this week in Applied Physics Letters.</description>

			<title>One-Third of Ph.D.s Lose Interest in Academic Careers, but Not for Lack of Jobs

			<description>There are growing concerns that the challenges of landing a faculty job are discouraging young science and engineering Ph.D.s from pursuing careers in academia. The assumption is the majority aspire to a faculty career but drop out of the academic pipeline because there just aren't enough tenure-track jobs to go around.</description>
